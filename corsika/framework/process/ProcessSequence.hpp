  /**
   * @defgroup Processes Physics Processes and Modules
   *
   * Physics processes in CORSIKA 8 are clustered in ProcessSequence and
   * SwitchProcessSequence containers. The former is a mere (ordered) collection, while
   * the latter has the option to switch between two alternative ProcessSequences.
   *
   * Depending on the type of data to act on and on the allowed actions of processes
   * there are several interface options:
   * - InteractionProcess
   * - DecayProcess
   * - ContinuousProcess
   * - StackProcess
   * - SecondariesProcess
   * - BoundaryCrossingProcess
   *
   * And all processes (including ProcessSequence and SwitchProcessSequence) are derived
   * from BaseProcess.
   *
   * Processes of any type (e.g. p1, p2, p3,...) can be assembled into a ProcessSequence
   * using the `make_sequence` factory function.
   *
   * @code
   *   auto sequence1 = make_sequence(p1, p2, p3);
   *   auto sequence2 = make_sequence(p4, p5, p6, p7);
   *   auto sequence3 = make_sequence(sequence1, sequemce2, p8, p9);
   * @endcode
   *
   * Note, if the order of processes
   * matters, the order of occurence
   * in the ProcessSequence determines
   * the executiion order.
   *
   * SecondariesProcess alyways act on
   * new secondaries produced (i.e. in
   * InteractionProcess and
   * DecayProcess) in the scope of
   * their ProcessSequence. For
   * example if i1 and i2 are
   * InteractionProcesses and s1 is a
   * SecondariesProcess, then:
   *
   * @code{.cpp}
   *   auto sequence = make_sequence(i1, make_sequence(i2, s1))
   * @endcode
   *
   * will result in s1 acting only on
   * the particles produced by i2 and
   * not by i1. This can be very
   * useful, e.g. to fine tune thinning.
   *
   * A special type of ProcessSequence
   * is SwitchProcessSequence, which
   * has two branches and a functor
   * that can select between these two
   * branches.
   *
   * @code{.cpp}
   *   auto sequence = make_switch(sequence1, sequence2, selector);
   * @endcode
   *
   * where the only requirement to
   * `selector` is that it
   * provides a `SwitchResult operator()(Particle const& particle) const` method. Thus,
   * based on the dynamic properties
   * of `particle` the functor
   * can make its decision. This is
   * clearly important for switching
   * between low-energy and
   * high-energy models, but not
   * limited to this. The selection
   * can even be done with a lambda
   * function.
   *
   * @class ProcessSequence
   * @ingroup Processes
   *
   *   Definition of a static process list/sequence.
   *
   *   A compile time static list of processes. The compiler will
   *   generate a new type based on template logic containing all the
   *   elements provided by the user.
   *
   *   TProcess1 and TProcess2 must both be derived from BaseProcess,
   *   and are both references if possible (lvalue), otherwise (rvalue)
   *   they are just classes. This allows us to handle both, rvalue as
   *   well as lvalue Processes in the ProcessSequence.
   *
   *   (For your potential interest,
   *   the static version of the
   *   ProcessSequence and all Process
   *   types are based on the CRTP C++
   *   design pattern).
   *
   *  Template parameters:
   *  @tparam TProcess1 is of type BaseProcess, either a dedicatd process, or a
   *           ProcessSequence
   *  @tparam TProcess2 is of type BaseProcess, either a dedicatd process, or a
   *           ProcessSequence
   *  @tparam IndexFirstProcess to count and index each Process in the entire
