Howto create new physics modules
================================

There are different types of physics modules, which you can add to the CORSIKA 8 physics process 
sequence. Modules can act on particles, secondaries or the entire stack. Modules can create new particles 
or they can modify or delete particles. They can also produce output. 

Types of different modules are explained in ::modules

When creating new modules, we suggest to stick as close as possible to the default CORSIKA 8 coding guidelines 
and code structure. This makes code review and sharing with others not more complicated than needed. 

When your modules creates output, use the available CORSIKA 8 output machinery. This is not explained here. Also learn 
how to use units, and use the loggers from the very beginning. Furthermore, get aquinted with C++17.  

Let's consider the case of an "InteractionProcess" which will remove the projectile particle and create 
secondary particles on the stack instead. It also has a cross section in order to evaulate the probability 
with respect to other InteractionProcesses. Create a header file `SimpleProcess.hpp`, which is conceptually
based to resemble (roughly) a Matthew-Heitler model:

.. code-block:: c++

   #pragma once

   #include <corsika/framework/core/ParticleProperties.hpp>
   #include <corsika/framework/core/PhysicalConstants.hpp>
   #include <corsika/framework/core/PhysicalUnits.hpp>
   #include <corsika/framework/core/Logging.hpp>
   #include <corsika/framework/process/InteractionProcess.hpp>
   #include <corsika/framework/random/RNGManager.hpp>

   namespace corsika::simple_process {

   class SimpleProcess : public corsika::InteractionProcess<SimpleProcess> {

   public:
      SimpleProcess();

      template <typename TParticle>
      GrammageType getInteractionLength(TParticle const&) const;

      template <typename TSecondaryView>
      void doInteraction(TSecondaryView& view) const;

   private:
      // the random number stream
      corsika::default_prng_type& rng_ =
         corsika::RNGManager<>::getInstance().getRandomStream("simple_process");

      // the logger
      std::shared_ptr<spdlog::logger> logger_ = get_logger("corsika_SimpleProcess");

   };

   }

   #include <SimpleProcess.inl>
   
And the corresponding `SimpleProcess.inl` as:

.. code-block:: c++
              
   Namespace corsika::simple_process
   {

   inline SimpleProcess::SimpleProcess() {}

   template <typename TParticle>
   inline GrammageType SimpleProcess::getInteractionLength(
         TParticle const &particle) const
   {
      // this process only applies to hadrons above Ekin=100GeV
     if (is_hadron(particle.getPID()) && particle.getKineticEnergy()>100_GeV) {
        return 2_g/square(1_cm);
      }
      // otherwise its cross section is 0
        return std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity() * 1_g/square(1_cm);
   }

   template <typename TSecondaryView>
   inline void SimpleProcess::doInteraction(TSecondaryView &view) const
   {
      // the actual projectile particle, which will disappear after the call to doInteraction finished.
      auto projectile = view.getProjectile();
      int const nMult = 15;
      auto pionEnergy = projectile.getEnergy() / nMult;

      auto const pOrig = projectile.getPosition();
      auto const tOrig = projectile.getTime();
      auto const projectileMomentum = projectile.getMomentum();
      auto const &cs = projectileMomentum.getCoordinateSystem();

      for (int iMult=0; iMult<nMult; ++iMult) {

         projectile.addSecondary(std::make_tuple(Code::PiPlus,
            projectileMomentum.normalized() * sqrt(square(pionEnergy) + square(PiPlus::mass)),
            pOrig,
            tOrig));
      }
      CORSIKA_LOGGER_INFO(logger_, "Created {} new secondaries of energy {}.", nMult, pionEnergy);
   }

   }
    
In this example, `TParticle` as used here in the SimpleModule is one
particle on the CORSIKA8 particle stack. It has all methods you expect
as `getPosition()`, `getEnergy()`, `getKineticEnergy()`, etc.

The `TSecondaryView` provides special access to the CORSIKA8 particle
stack as needed for a particle interaction with a projectile and
secondaries. For example, `getProjectil()` will return the actual
projectile particle, `addSecondary(...)` will produce a secondary of
the projectil. The advantage of addSecondary wrt. addParticle is that
there exists a direct reference to the projectile allowing to
automatically copy weights, keep the cascade history,
etc. Furthermore, you can define subsequent `SeoncariesProcesses`
which can further process all the newly created secondaries. This
could perform energy threshold cuts, or also calculate new weights,
etc.
   
The SimpleProcess is not necessarily useful for anything and its sole purpuse is to illustrate the mechanism to 
create your own processes. 

You can then include such a process in your programm (e.g. in vertical_EAS) with
 - add: `#include <SimpleProcess.hpp>`
 - register the new random stream: `RNGManager<>::getInstance().registerRandomStream("simple_process");`
 - initialize it with `simple_process::SimpleProcess simple; `
 - add it to the physiscs sequence i.e. via `auto extended_sequence = make_sequence(old_sequence, simple);`

Please follow the style and guidelines for programming CORSIKA 8 code even for
private projects. Your code will be covered by the BSD 3-Clause License, too,
and thus should be made public to the community. Any discussion or eventual
bug-fixing is much more complicated if there are deviations from the guidelines.
