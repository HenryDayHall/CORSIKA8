## Changes

Closes #....

## Developers

- The versions have been updated
  - [ ] The cpp version (see top-level CMakeLists.txt)
  - [ ] The python reader version (see [pyproject.toml](../../python/pyproject.toml))
- [ ] The MR is without `WIP/Draft` status
- [ ] The most recent CI jobs pass all steps (make sure to check the `Pipelines` page)
  - if "check clang-format" failed: the code contributor has to run `./do-clang-format.py --apply` eventually with the `--all` option
  - if "check copyright" failed the code contributor has to run`./do-copyright.py --add=20xy`
- [ ] Make sure also the jobs with MR-label `ready for code review` succeed. This includes the optional jobs, in particular 'coverage', 'release-full-clang-14", "release-full-u-22_04" and make sure no problems occur. You may have to trigger a pipeline manually to check this.
- [ ] Check in the "coverage" job output that the coverage did not decrease. It should always stay, or increase. If it decreased --> ask contributor to add further needed unit tests, and check coverage report.
- When all above is done:
  - [ ] **Add MR label `Code Review Finished`**
